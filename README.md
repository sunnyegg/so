# Shoutout Tool

[Shoutout Tool](https://so.sunnyegg.id) is an app where you can shoutout people who came to your stream on Twitch.

I see a lot of streamers like to shoutout people who come on their stream, to support them, or just to see their clips popping out on their stream. However, they need to ALT-Tab to their OBS just to type "!so" and go back to whatever they're doing. With this app, I hope streamers can just focus on their stream and let this app handle the shoutouting activity. This app also keep track on everyone who come on the stream.

## Features

- Shoutout (no shit sherlock)
